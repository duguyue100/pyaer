PyAER with Swig Bindings

Special thanks to [iniLabs](http://inilabs.com/) for making this possible.

The project is in its Alpha development stage, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/duguyue100/pyaer/issues) if you need our help.

## Design Principle

+ Minimum installation effort
+ Keep Python 2 and 3 in mind
+ Clean, simple, easy to manage
+ Well documented, human-readable code

## Installation

1. Install bleeding-edge `libcaer` dependency (RECOMMEND)

    ```
    $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duguyue100/pyaer/master/install-libcaer.sh)
    ```

    __NOTE:__ To build `libcaer` on Windows, please follow [this description](https://github.com/inilabs/libcaer/blob/master/README.Windows).

    __NOTE:__ For more information, see [`libcaer` repo](https://github.com/inilabs/libcaer).

    __NOTE:__ From 0.1.0a18, we support eDVS, you will need to install `libserialport` so that the package can work properly, follow the building instructions from [here](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Libserialport). Currently, this support is not built into the release since we are not clear how useful is this feature. If you are interested, you can build the project from scratch.

2. Directly install from pypi (RECOMMEND)

    ```
    $ pip install pyaer -U
    ```

3. Install from source

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/duguyue100/pyaer.git
    $ make install
    ```

## Got a Linux?

`libcaer` relies on `libusb` based driver, you won't be able
to access the camera unless fixing the `udev` rules. Refer to details
at [here](https://inivation.com/support/hardware/davis240/#linux).

```bash
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duguyue100/pyaer/master/install-udev.sh)
```
